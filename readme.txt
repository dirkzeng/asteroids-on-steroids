Here is a list of highlighted features I would like to make sure are seen when graded...

STARS:  When stars are spawned they are small and white.  When they collide with friends they grow and change colors.  After 12 collisions and when they are a "red giant" the star expires and spawns a black hole in the location the star was.

BLACK HOLES:  Black holes do not move but spin very quickly for effect.  If a moveable collides with the black hole it gets sucked in and expires.  If a moveable is within the radius of the black hole plus a certain amount X (depending on the moveable), it changes direction and gets pulled toward the black hole.

JEZZBALLS (Comets):  These are small red comets that bounce off the edges of the dimension instead of wrapping to the other side.  When a comet collides it creates a massive explosion.  Any foe that collides with the explosion is removed.

MISSILE ('F' key):  I have edited the special missile to stop after being shot.  Once it is stopped it starts spinning and shoots bullets of it's own until it expired. You can only fire one of these at a time and must wait for the current missile to expire before firing another one. 

NUKES ('N' key):  You start the game with one nuke.  You can collect more nukes by colliding with orange floaters.  When you have a nuke available, you can press 'N' and it will trigger a nuke explosion that collides with all foes on the screen.  You can see how many nukes you have in the bottom left.

FALCON and SHIELDS METER:  The falcon now takes 3 hits to die.  The first two hits trigger a bump noise and a small flash.  The third hit triggers a larger explosion.  The falcon's hit status can be monitored in the SHIELDS meter in the top right.     

OTHER Features:  Unique debris for sprites, coloring, different floater power ups, scoring, unique sounds, and more...
